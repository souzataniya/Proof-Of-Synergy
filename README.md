An AI communication gym. Practice real conversations by voice, get live coaching, and build a skill graph that persists across sessions. Includes a resume-based technical interview mode.

## Stack

Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind. OpenTelemetry is used for optional end-to-end tracing. Gemini is the live conversation partner; Sarvam handles voice (speech-to-text, text-to-speech) and coaching summaries. Cognee is an optional semantic layer for the skill graph. Everything degrades gracefully: with no keys the app runs on a local conversation partner, heuristic coaching, and the built-in skill-graph engine.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Other scripts: `npm run build`, `npm start`, `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run typecheck`,
`npm run check` (typecheck + test), `npm run voice-gateway` (standalone WebSocket signaling server
for realtime voice sessions, see `server/voice-gateway.ts`).

## Config

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your keys. Everything is optional; the app degrades gracefully without keys.

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=      # live conversation partner (dialogue, follow-ups, pushback)
SARVAM_API_KEY=      # voice: STT, TTS, resume OCR, and coaching summaries
COGNEE_API_URL=      # optional skill-graph semantic layer
COGNEE_API_KEY=
DEMO_MODE=           # true swaps in labelled sample data when a service is down; never in prod
```

See `.env.local.example` for optional model/voice overrides and defaults.

## Features

- Voice practice with live transcription and auto-stop on pause.
- Technical interview: upload a resume (PDF, Word, or scan via OCR) plus an optional job description; questions are tailored to it. Hands-free (reads each question, opens the mic) and auto-ends after about 15 to 20 minutes.
- Skill graph: technologies actually discussed become skill nodes, grouped by category. Skills are credited only from what the candidate said.
- Session summary with metrics and coaching.

## Observability (optional)

End-to-end traces of the interview flow can be sent to [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/)
via OpenTelemetry — free, and off by default. Run Phoenix locally
(`docker run -p 6006:6006 -p 4317:4317 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest`), set
`PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:6006` in `.env.local`, and each request shows up as
LLM/chain/tool spans. See [`docs/observability.md`](docs/observability.md) for local vs. Phoenix
Cloud setup and the full span map.

## Layout

- `app/` pages (`practice`, `practice/realtime`, `knowledge-graph`) and API routes (`app/api/*`:
  coaching, gemini, health, interview, scenarios, skill-graph, telemetry, transcribe, tts, voice)
- `components/` UI, including the knowledge-graph explorer and realtime voice recorder
- `lib/` core logic — skill graph, prompts, Sarvam/Gemini clients, resume parsing, the
  `lib/interview/` conversation pipeline, and `lib/voice-client/` browser-side realtime audio
- `server/` WebSocket signaling server for voice sessions (`voice-gateway.ts`)
- `benchmarks/` deterministic benchmark harness for the voice interview pipeline — see
  [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md)
- `docs/` observability and voice architecture notes
